# EC_2018_T32
The great work of team 32

# Attention
*To keep it as cross platform as possible, (e.g. Guiseppe had the player32.java in the parent directory, while in eclipse it goes under src/) I put the src/ in the gitignore.* 
To circumvent this create a symbolic link to the parent directory;
In Windows:
1. cd to the src/
2. mklink /H player32.java ..\player32.java
If you get an invalid switch error, you didn't use the correct slash, read the previous line again
